## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. The File Paths Were Glitching A Bit So I Had To Put The Exact File Paths For The Images, You Will Have To Adjust Them According To The File Path You May Find On Your Computer.
   For Example I Have ```<Image source={require('/Users/likhith/Desktop/RAM LAB Programs/ArousalPleasureSliders/assets/images/unaroused.png')} style={styles.icon} />```, You Need To Update That.
3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
